# Sliding Puzzle Project #

The objective of this project is to build a small slidinge puzzle game, given the following requirements:
	- a game field of 3x3 with 8 blocks and one gap; if a block is clicked that borders the gap, it moves into the gap
	- random start locations; but without any duplicate blocks
	- the blocks are numbered; 1 to 8
	- responsiveness; the game size adjusts to screen size
	- a counter tracking the amount of moves
